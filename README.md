## For Instructors

- Each tutorial lives in `tutorials/NN-short-name/`
- `starter/` = scaffold given to students
- `solution/` = reference answer (keep on a private branch or separate private repo if this is graded work)
- Tag releases as `vX.Y-cohort` (e.g. `v1.0-2026-freshman`) to version per intake
